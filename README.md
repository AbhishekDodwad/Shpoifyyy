"Shoppifyy," an e-commerce platform that allows users to browse, search, and purchase products, while enabling admins to upload products with images and manage stock. On the frontend, I used React.js, Bootstrap, and Context API to design a responsive UI with category filtering and dynamic cart management. Backend services were developed using Java Spring Boot and RESTful APIs, ensuring robust and scalable performance. I also integrated multipart form data handling for image uploads and implemented real-time stock updates. This project deepened my understanding of full-stack architecture and taught me how to build seamless interactions between frontend and backend using Axios and REST APIs.
